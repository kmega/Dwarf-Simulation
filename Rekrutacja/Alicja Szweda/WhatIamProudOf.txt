	I am proud of the Hospital class, because this class responsibility is to create Dwarfs,
which most of the classes contains in their structures. This is significant for me of the
reason that my team trusted me and they believed that I can do that - without created Dwarfs 
- all aplication can't work properly. I also like this element of the project, because I've 
learned there a lot - one person from my team teached me how to use the Mock Library and test 
"Randomizer", which I have used in Hospital class to take into account randomness of 
born new Dwarfs. I used that Mock in "HospitalTests" and now I know how to use it.
Hospital tests are also the proofs that my classes work properly and that the rest of the 
team can use them without worrying about the bugs. 
	I am also proud of my progress in programming. There is a lot of object, which I need 
to connect and a lot of significant decision to make- how to create the structure of 
application to don't get lost in our code later.
I had also a lot of fun with cooperating with other people and talking about how to connect
our classes and what I can do to make their work easier and quicker. 
	And also, I think, the most important thing is the fact, that I've solved the problem 
I was asked, my code is working and I can prove that. My code isn't perfect, but I can find
there some positive elements, which I like. The code is mostly readable and understandable 
and my team understood it without problems. I had excellent cooperation with my team and 
we've solved all problems together - problems with merging files happened rarely than with 
previous projects, because  we had planned our aplication carefully to make our work easier. 
I've learned new things and I've found that my programming skills are definitely better than 
two months ago. Moreover, thanks to this application, I have more experience in programming now.
